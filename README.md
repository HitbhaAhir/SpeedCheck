By using this framework, the built in GPS sensor can communicate  the following datas to the app: actual speed, location, altitude, compass values..  and a lot more! From these values, you can calculate the average, maximum speed, time to get from A to B


List of  **Basic   Stories**  completed:

- [x] Track speed using Corelocation framework
- [  ] calculate the average, maximum speed, time to get from A to B
- [x] Display user location on Map in real time
